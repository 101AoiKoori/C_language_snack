<p>OO languages? it's a mess.</p>

Programming in C is better than anything they've got over there
The syntax might seem much sweeter
Where objects and subtypes play
But frills like inheritance
Will only get in the way!
Admire C's simple landscape
Efficiently dangerous!
No templates or fancy pitfalls...
like Java and C++!

Program in C~
Program in C~

Pointers, assembly
Manage your memory
With malloc() and free()!
Don't sink your app with runtime bloat
Software in C will stay afloat
Do what you want there
Close to the hardware
Program in C!
