<p>Ariel, listen to me</p>
<p>OO languages? it's a mess.</p>

<p>Programming in C is better than anything they've got over there</p>
<p>The syntax might seem much sweeter</p>
<p>Where objects and subtypes play</p>
<p>But frills like inheritance</p>
<p>Will only get in the way!</p>
<p>Admire C's simple landscape</p>
<p>Efficiently dangerous!</p>
<p>No templates or fancy pitfalls...</p>
<p>like Java and C++!</p>

<p>Program in C~</p>
<p>Program in C~</p>

<p>Pointers, assembly</p>
<p>Manage your memory</p>
<p>With malloc() and free()!</p>
<p>Don't sink your app with runtime bloat</p>
<p>Software in C will stay afloat</p>
<p>Do what you want there</p>
<p>Close to the hardware</p>
<p>Program in C!</p>
